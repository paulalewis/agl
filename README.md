About
-----

This software was originally created for my thesis to test the UCT
algorithm in various domains.

Domains:
- [backgammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backgammon)
- [biniax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biniax)
- [connect4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect4)
- [draughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts)
- [EinStein w√ºrfelt nicht!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EinStein_w%C3%BCrfelt_nicht!)
- [havannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havannah)
- [hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29)
- [hexdame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexdame)
- [yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee)

Agents:
- random - basic agent randomly selects an action
- uct - agent based on UCT algorithm with some additions
- console - agent for human input from console
- external - agent for input from external interfaces such as a gui

Setup
-----

1. Install ant
2. Install java sdk 1.7

Build
-----

Create a jar file with no main so it can be used as library.

1. clean and build the project `ant clean dist`

Run Domain Test
---------------

Build jar with DomainTest.java as main to test software from console.

1. clean the project `ant clean install`
2. run `java -jar agl.jar <test_filepath> [output_filepath]`

Some example test files are located in res/domainTests/.
